            <h3 class="title">10/2/2025 - Holy, Unreal engine sucks</h3>
            <p> How long should it take for code to compile? Because in every instance I've seen it has taken no more than 30 seconds. Apparently Unreal though decided that having working compilers is not nessacary. I let it compile for 2 hours. I am not exxagerating in any way. It still was not done. I am doing my best not to cuss because this is the worst thing I have ever seen in anything considred proffesinal. I can't remember the name of the thing they added because the name is the most generic, stupid thing you can think of and all it does is gimp your computer to make it take forever. with no way to disable it. I have gone from liking Unreal Engine to despising it in 1 week becaues of how absolutely braindead the C++ is in version 5.5 and 5.6. I wish disease, poor harvest, and emotional pain for anyone who had a hand in adding it to unreal engine. </p>

            <h3 class="title">8/17/2025 - leitmotifs are so cool</h3>
            <p> I have been listening to the DELTARUNE soundtrack for a week now, its so good and its so cool to hear all the leitmotifs. Basically every song is a fusion of like a bunch of leitmotifs. Its cool on a surface level but its so useful at helping tell stories and themes with the music. Just the Freedom Motif alone creates so much cool themes just by existing in a song. It also just is really cool to see characters get entire soundtracks around them just based on there leitmotif. Mr.Tenna's leitmotif alone made him a top pick for me, never understood what people meant by comfort character really meant until then. I have a photo of him on my desk now.</p>
